\section{Experiments}\label{sec:experiments}

Mokaminter has been installed on the personal phone of
a group of $11$ students from \emph{Anonymous during submission}.
Each of them created a miner for the Hotmoka blockchain
and let it run in the phone for a day. A the end, they collected
statistics about two quality metrics:
amount of data exchanged
and percentage of used battery, as reported by
the Android system in the settings page for Mokaminter.
The result is that Mokaminter exchanged $0.808$ megabytes
per day and consumed $0.27\%$ of battery, on average.
These numbers depend, of course, from the quality of the network
connection and from the use of other apps in the phone, but the
experiment was meant to leave students free to use their phone as
they are used to, in order to measure costs in a realistic setting
that reflects personal use patterns.

The quality of mobile internet in the area of \emph{Anonymous} where
the experiment has been conducted is low in comparison to other areas
of the country. Still, Mokaminter worked and mined without problems.
To push this test to te limit, Mokaminter has been used during
an international flight, using the minimal free internet connection
provided on board. Even in this extremely adverse condition, Mokaminter
worked and mined.

In conclusion, these simple, yet limited experiments show that
Mokaminter is actually working, in every internet condition,
and that its comsumption is minimal, in terms of bandwidth and
battery usage.
