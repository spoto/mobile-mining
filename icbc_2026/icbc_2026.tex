\begin{abstract}
  This paper advocates the use of mobile phones as blockchain mining devices.
  Namely, mobile phones form a large and cheap hardware base for mining, which is
  interesting, in particular, during the start-up phase of a new blockchain, when it might
  be difficult to convince people to install a complex software product
  on a continously connected computer. It acknowledges that mining on mobile phones
  has hardware requirements that make it impractical for most mining algorithms,
  but it identifies the notable exception of proof of space. Namely, the latter mining
  algorithm preallocates
  a large data structure on disk, that is later used for mining, with an
  algorithm that is inexpensive in terms of CPU execution and data exchanged. Therefore,
  proof of space matches perfectly the limited resources of a mobile phone.
  This paper presents Mokaminter, a new Android app for mining blockchains based
  on the generic Mokamint proof of space engine.
  It reports experiments with Mokaminter, that confirm its low battery usage,
  the reduced amount of data exchanged during mining and its ability to work
  also in adverse network conditions. To the best of our knowlegde,
  Mokaminter is the first mobile app for mining.
