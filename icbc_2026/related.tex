\section{Related Work}\label{sec:related_work}

There is a lack of scientific research on the use of mobile phones for blockchain mining.
In~\cite{LeePSB20}, a blockchain system is proposed, to build local blockchains
for industrial IoT networks, where mobile miners are drones that mine blocks
through proof of work. Their approach does not scale
to a global blockchain and to mobile phones, since
the latters would not be competitive against expensive specialized hardware
and the mining process would immediately drain their battery.
The same consideration applies to~\cite{SuankaewmaneeHN18}, that
presents a specialized blockchain for mobile commerce
whose miners are Android phones that perform the proof of work.
Experiments are reported for blocks holding up to six transactions,
which is sensible for a local blockchain but irrealistic for a global one.
Despite its title, a different problem is tackled
in~\cite{JiangLW22}, namely, how to offload blockchain applications
to a cloud computing provider so that such applications become
usable with the limited resources of a mobile phone.

A simple search on Google Play lists quite a few Android apps for
\emph{crypto mining}. A deeper look makes it clear that such apps,
despite their descriptions, are not miners of cryptocurrencies, but rather:

\begin{itemize}
  \item mobile dashboards
    to cloud pool mining applications.
    This is the case, for instance, of Ct Pool (\website{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.ctpool}), ViaBTC (\website{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.viabtc.pool}),
    ECOS (\website{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=am.ecos.android}),
    Cloud mining Bitcoin Crypto (\website{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cmio.id1739008702352}),
    MineX (\website{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grenterprise.minexcryptomining})
    and many more;
  \item or dubious games that promise Bitcoins in exchange of help for solving some tasks
    or in exchange of watching promotional content. This is the case, for instance,
    of Bitcoin Miner Earn Real Crypto (\website{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fumbgames.bitcoinminor}) and
    Crypto Fortune Tycoon: BTCMiner (\website{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.minertycoon.ripple}).
\end{itemize}
