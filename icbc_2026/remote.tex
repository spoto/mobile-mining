\section{Remote Mining on a Mobile Phone}\label{sec:remote_mining}

It seems natural to move the two software parts in
Fig.~\ref{fig:local_mining} into distinct machines connected by a network,
as in Fig.~\ref{fig:remote_mining}.
This is because many users want to run a miner, and earn cryptos,
but only a few are typically interested in running a full blockchain peer in their machine,
which requires technical skills, database space, a very good internet connection
and a dedicated machine.

However, this graphically simple modification might result useless or impractical,
depending on the characteristics of the mining algorithm and of the machine
where the remote miner will run. Let us consider, in particular, the case when the latter
is a mobile phone and the mining algorithm is one of those discussed
in Sec.~\ref{sec:introduction}.

\subsubsection*{Proof of work}
%
In this case, the challenge includes the full block being
created, since its nonce must maximize its hash.
For Bitcoin, a block can be up to 1~MB, or even 4~MB after the Segregated Witness upgrade.
This data must be exchanged for the creation of \emph{each} block, which is hard in many
countries, where mobile internet is slow; moreover, most mobile operators fix a maximum number of
GB exchanged in the month, which would be easily exhausted; finally, the computational cost
of proof of work would drain the phone's battery. These considerations are enough
to conclude that, at the moment, mining with proof of work, on a mobile phone,
for a global blockchain such as Bitcoin, is irrealistic.

\subsubsection*{Proof of stake}
%
In this case, mining is very cheap and limited to the validators. The exchanged data is minimal.
But validators have no reason to offload the very simple mining activity.
Therefore, mining on a mobile phone is possible for proof of stake, but it does
not seem of any practical interest.

\subsubsection*{Proof of space}
%
In this last case, mining requires the use of disk space, but no significant
CPU power. Currently, mobile phones have an average disk space
of 256~GB, smaller than the average 1000~GB of desktop computers, but still significant.
Moreover, the proof of space of~\cite{Spoto25} uses very small challenges (around 64 bytes)
and answers (nonces, compacted into \emph{deadlines} of around 200 bytes).
The block being created is not needed for mining. This makes that
algorithm ideal for a remote miner in a mobile phone:
no need of significant CPU power, enough disk space in the phone and little data exchange.
This is why it has been the choice for the implementation of our Mokaminter app.
